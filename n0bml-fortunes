When I'm working on a problem, I never think about beauty... but when
I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it's wrong.

If success or failure of this planet and of human beings depended on
how I am and what I do...  HOW WOULD I BE?  WHAT WOULD I DO?

One accurate measurement is worth a thousand expert opinions.

Science is like sex: sometimes something useful comes out, but that's
not why we're doing it.

As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain;
and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.
    -- Albert Einstein.

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what
the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be
replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.
There is another theory which states that this has already happened...

For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and
wrong.

A successful book is not made of what is in it, but what is left out of it.

Emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same
way that the noonday sun does the stars.  It is not just bigger and
brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish.

Scientists investigate that which already is; engineers create that
which has never been.
    -- Albert Einstein

A good scientist is a person with original ideas.  A good engineer is a
person who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as
possible.  There are no prima donnas in engineering.

What I cannot create, I do not understand.

I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart
like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain
unfolding to success.

NO NEED SHALL STAND UNADDRESSED.  There is a way to make things better.

NO CRAFT SHALL PASS UNAPPRECIATED.  It is always worthwhile to pause
and intake a thing of beauty.  Plus, it may spark a concordant idea of
one's own.

THE EFFORT ITSELF IS THE REWARD.  Yes, I did spend three days on a
device to save me ten minutes.  You are missing the point of the
process.

A FAILURE IS SIMPLY AN EXPERIMENT.  Most efforts will fail.  Rarely
should the same failure repeat itself.
%
MISCELLANEOUS PARTS ARE LIFE.  I'm keeping that becaue I will need it
someday.  Last time I threw something out, I needed it the very next
day.
%
PROBLEMS ARE DESIGNED TO BE SOLVED.  Spring into action.  Make it
happen.  Hannibal was right: I *love* it when a plan comes together.
%
PROJECTS ARE STACKABLE.  It's not that I'm starting something new
before finishing something old -- I'm *nesting* the new project
*inside* the old.

IF IT HAS SCREWS, THEY SHALL BE TURNED.  If it has bolts, they shall
be loosened.  If it has rivets, they may get alont for a while without
being pried open, but that probably won't last.
%
IF IT IS BROKEN, IT IS FAIR GAME.  Maybe I can fix it.  Maybe I can
use some of its parts for something else.  Maybe I just want clearance
to be more rough than usual when opening up the case.
